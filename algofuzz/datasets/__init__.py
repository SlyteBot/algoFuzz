"""
This module contains datasets that can be used to evaluate clustering algorithms.

The datasets are categorized into two types:

1. Toy Datasets:
    - ``bubble_gen``: Generates artificial testing scenarios for clustering algorithms.
    - ``prev_bubble_gen``: Another simpler generator for creating artificial testing scenarios.

2. Real-life Datasets:
    - ``glass``: A dataset containing the refractive index and the amounts of eight elements in glass.

These datasets are designed to help in testing and evaluating the performance of various clustering algorithms.
