algoFuzz: Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Framework
===========================================

.. title:: Introduction

``algoFuzz`` is a unique framework dedicated to the implementation and comparison of various fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms found in academic literature. It provides a comprehensive environment for researchers and practitioners to explore and compare different clustering methodologies.

If you're new to fuzzy clustering or looking to learn more about the algorithms and techniques supported by ``algoFuzz``, check out the :doc:`Getting Started <getting_started>` section for a quick introduction and example usage. You can also refer to the :doc:`API Reference <reference/index>` for detailed information on the available algorithms, parameters, and methods.


Key Features
-----

- It is built on top of the popular `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html>`_ library, leveraging its robust data processing and machine learning capabilities. It **aims to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical application**, enabling users to experiment with cutting-edge clustering algorithms in a user-friendly and accessible manner. 

- The framework is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing users to **easily implement and integrate new algorithms into the existing codebase**. 

- It also **provides a set of common datasets, evaluation metrics**, and visualization tools to facilitate the comparison and analysis of clustering results.
